_**This chatbot, named Edith, is designed for individuals who are interested in maintaining their fitness but have no idea where to start. Edith provides nutrition tips and various types of exercises suitable for beginners. Additionally, Edith can be helpful for those who are already hitting the gym.
To create this chatbot, we used the GPT-2 large language model from the OpenAI community. The GPT-2 large model is a generative language model developed by OpenAI and is part of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series. It features a transformer-based neural network architecture with approximately 774 million parameters, 24 layers, 16 attention heads per layer, and 1024-dimensional hidden layers. Trained on a diverse dataset called WebText, which consists of text from around 8 million web pages, GPT-2 large has a broad understanding of language and knowledge. This allows it to perform a variety of tasks such as text generation, text completion, translation, summarization, and question answering.
GPT-2 large is particularly versatile and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, making it adaptable for numerous applications such as creating conversational chatbots, generating content for blogs and social media, aiding in creative writing, generating code snippets, and serving as an educational tool for tutoring and answering questions. For this project, we have used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.
The dataset used for this project is the “HazSylvia/Fitness_Unformatted” dataset, which consists of 967 queries related to fitness and related questions.
In this repository, we have used the "openai-community/gpt2-large" model to create a large language model (LLM) chatbot.**_
